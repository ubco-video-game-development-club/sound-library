# UBCO VGDC Sound Library
A sound library for use in the UBCO Video Game Development Club.

## Navigation
At the top level, you will find 3 folders:
1. Ambience
2. Music
3. SFX
4. Voiceover

Ambience contains ambient soundscapes sorted by type (e.g. nature, city).

Music is sorted by type (i.e. "active" or "ambient") and genre.

The SFX folder contains sound effects, sorted by type (e.g. shooting, footsteps, etc.).

Voiceover contains voice clips. This is meant for generic VO clips as opposed to entire monologues.
